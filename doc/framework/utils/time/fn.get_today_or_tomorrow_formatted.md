Expand description

:::: docblock
Formats the current date or the next day's date based on the current UTC
time.

The function checks the current UTC time against a cutoff time of
18:30:00. If the current time is past the cutoff, the date for the next
day is returned. Otherwise, the current date is returned. The returned
date is formatted as `dd-mmm-yyyy` in lowercase. Note that getting the
next day is done safely, handling potential overflow (e.g. the last day
of the year).

Returns:

A lowercase String representing the formatted date.
