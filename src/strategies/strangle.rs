Strangle Strategy

A strangle involves simultaneously buying an out-of-the-money call and an out-of-the-money put option with the same expiration date.
This strategy is similar to a straddle but typically has a lower cost and requires a larger price move to become profitable.

Key characteristics:
- Unlimited profit potential
- Lower cost than a straddle
- Requires a larger price move to become profitable
