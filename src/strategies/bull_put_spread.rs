Bull Put Spread Strategy

A bull put spread involves selling a put option with a higher strike price and buying a put option with a lower strike price, both with the same expiration date.
This strategy is used when a moderate increase in the underlying asset's price is expected.

Key characteristics:
- Limited profit potential (net premium received)
- Limited risk (difference between strikes minus net premium)
- Generate income while maintaining a bullish outlook
- Both put options have the same expiration date
- Requires less capital than naked put selling
- Lower risk than naked put selling
- Maximum profit achieved when price stays above higher strike
