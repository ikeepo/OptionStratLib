Bear Put Spread Strategy

A bear put spread involves buying a put option with a higher strike price and selling a put option with a lower strike price, both with the same expiration date.
This strategy is used when a moderate decline in the underlying asset's price is expected.

Key characteristics:
- Limited profit potential
- Limited risk
- Lower cost than buying a put option outright
