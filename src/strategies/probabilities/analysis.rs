/// # StrategyProbabilityAnalysis
///
/// Represents the probabilistic analysis of an options trading strategy, providing key metrics
/// for risk assessment and expected outcomes.
///
/// This struct contains various probability-based metrics that help traders evaluate the
/// potential performance of a strategy under different market scenarios.
///
/// ## Fields
/// * `probability_of_profit`: The probability that the strategy will result in a profit at expiration.
///   This is a key metric for assessing the overall likelihood of success.
///
/// * `probability_of_max_profit`: The probability that the strategy will achieve its maximum possible profit.
///   This typically occurs when specific price conditions are met at expiration.
///
/// * `probability_of_max_loss`: The probability that the strategy will experience its maximum possible loss.
///   Understanding this risk metric is crucial for proper position sizing and risk management.
///
/// * `expected_value`: The mathematical expectation of the strategy's outcome, calculated by multiplying
///   possible profits and losses by their respective probabilities. A positive expected value suggests
///   the strategy is favorable in the long run.
///
/// * `break_even_points`: The price levels at which the strategy neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss.
///   These are important reference points for monitoring strategy performance.
///
/// * `risk_reward_ratio`: The ratio between the potential loss and the potential gain of the strategy.
///   Lower values generally indicate more favorable risk-adjusted opportunities.
///
/// This analysis is typically generated through statistical models or Monte Carlo simulations
/// that incorporate factors such as implied volatility, time to expiration, and price movement
/// probabilities.
