Iron Condor Strategy

An iron condor involves selling an out-of-the-money put spread and an out-of-the-money call spread with the same expiration date.
This strategy is used when little volatility in the underlying asset's price is expected.

Key characteristics:
- Limited profit potential
- Limited risk
- Profit is highest when the underlying asset price remains between the two sold options at expiration
