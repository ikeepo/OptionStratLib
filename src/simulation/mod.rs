//! # Random Walk Simulation Library
//!
//! This library provides tools for simulating and analyzing random walk processes
//! and other stochastic models. It includes implementations of various random walk algorithms,
//! statistical utilities, and visualization capabilities.
//!
//! The library is organized into several modules:
//! - `model`: Contains the data structures and types that represent stochastic processes
//! - `simulator`: Provides simulation engines and algorithms for running the models
//! - `utils`: Utility functions and helpers for statistical analysis and data manipulation
//! - `walk`: Public API for creating and running random walk simulations
//!
//! ## Core Components
//!
//! ## Mathematical Background
//!
//! The random walk implementation follows the geometric Brownian motion model with:
//!
//! 1. Price changes: dS = μSdt + σSdW
//!    - S: Asset price
//!    - μ: Drift (mean return)
//!    - σ: Volatility
//!    - dW: Wiener process increment
//!
//! 2. Volatility updates: σ(t) ~ N(σ, σ_change)
//!    - Stochastic volatility component
//!    - Updates based on volatility_window
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Geometric Brownian motion simulation
//! - Stochastic volatility modeling
//! - Real-time volatility estimation
//! - Integration with option pricing parameters
//! - Visualization support
//! - Iterator interface for sequential processing
//!
//! ## Performance Considerations
//!
//! - Time Complexity: O(n) for generation, where n is the number of steps
//! - Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the price path
//! - Volatility calculation: O(w) where w is the volatility window size
//!
//! ## Implementation Notes
//!
//! - All prices are strictly positive (enforced by Positive)
//! - Volatility is estimated using rolling windows
//! - The iterator provides option pricing parameters for each step
//! - Thread-safe random number generation
//! - Supports various time frames (daily, weekly, monthly)

/// # Random Walk Module
///
/// This module provides implementations of various random walk algorithms and related utilities.
/// Random walks are mathematical objects that describe a path consisting of a succession of random steps
/// in some mathematical space.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Typically used for stochastic process simulation and analysis, Monte Carlo methods,
/// and modeling natural phenomena with random components.

/// Module containing functionality for stepping through data or calculations.
///
/// This module provides components and utilities for managing step-based operations,
/// such as iterative calculations, data processing steps, or any process that requires
/// incremental progression through a series of operations.
///
/// The stepping functionality is particularly useful for scenarios where:
/// - Operations need to be performed in a specific sequence
/// - Progress tracking is required through a multi-stage process
/// - Incremental state changes need to be managed

/// # Usage
///
/// Traits defined in this module are typically implemented by concrete types
/// throughout the library to ensure consistent behavior and interoperability
/// between different components of the system.

///
/// # Usage
///
/// Parameter structures from this module are used as inputs to the various
/// financial models, pricing functions, and simulation methods throughout the library.
/// They encapsulate all the necessary inputs while ensuring proper validation.
