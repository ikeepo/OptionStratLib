/// Represents a comprehensive set of statistical and analytical metrics for curve data.
///
/// # Overview
/// The `CurveMetrics` structure aggregates various metrics that describe different
/// aspects of a curve in a unified form. It provides an encapsulated representation of
/// curve information that spans different categories, including basic statistical measures,
/// shape characteristics, range details, trend analysis, and risk evaluation.
///
/// ## Components
///
/// - **Basic Metrics (`basic`)**:
///   Includes fundamental statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
///   These measures provide a quick overview of the distribution of the observations within the curve.
///
/// - **Shape Metrics (`shape`)**:
///   Captures the structural characteristics of the curve, such as skewness, kurtosis,
///   the locations of peaks and valleys, and the points where the curve inflects.
///   Useful for understanding curve symmetry, tail behavior, and general shape nuances.
///
/// - **Range Metrics (`range`)**:
///   Describes the range of the data, including minimum and maximum observed points,
///   the extent between these points, and quartile-based statistical details such as
///   interquartile range. Particularly helpful when analyzing variability in data distribution.
///
/// - **Trend Metrics (`trend`)**:
///   Measures the directional tendencies of the curve over time. Includes the slope,
///   intercept, and statistical goodness-of-fit (RÂ² value) as well as moving averages.
///   Ideal for identifying long-term trends and evaluating the predictive nature of the curve.
///
/// - **Risk Metrics (`risk`)**:
///   Quantifies curve risk using various financial metrics, such as volatility, value-at-risk (VaR),
///   expected shortfall, beta, and the Sharpe ratio. These metrics are often used to evaluate
///   the risk-return profile in financial contexts.
///
/// ## Usage
/// This structure is particularly helpful in domains requiring holistic curve analysis,
/// such as:
///
/// - **Financial Analysis**:
///   Used to analyze return curves and assess the risk-return trade-offs for financial products or strategies.
/// - **Data Science**:
///   Provides comprehensive insights into a dataset's distribution, shape, and trends over time.
/// - **Scientific Research**:
///   Useful for analyzing phenomena modeled by curves in domains like physics, biology, or economics.
///
/// ## Field Descriptions
///
/// - **basic**: [`BasicMetrics`]
///   - Contains mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the dataset.
/// - **shape**: [`ShapeMetrics`]
///   - Captures the shape-related characteristics such as skewness, kurtosis, and extrema (peaks/valleys).
/// - **range**: [`RangeMetrics`]
///   - Includes range, min/max points, and quartiles for the dataset.
/// - **trend**: [`TrendMetrics`]
///   - Represents the directional tendencies, moving averages, and regression characteristics.
/// - **risk**: [`RiskMetrics`]
///   - Evaluates financial risk metrics such as volatility and Sharpe ratio.
///
/// ## Example Workflow
/// The `CurveMetrics` structure is usually constructed by combining its fields using the individual
/// metric structures (`BasicMetrics`, `ShapeMetrics`, `RangeMetrics`, `TrendMetrics`, `RiskMetrics`).
/// It is often initialized as part of a larger curve analysis operation and may be transformed or queried for
/// generating insights.

///   that highlight its geometrical features, such as high/low points and areas
///   where the curvature direction changes.
///
/// # Fields
/// - **skewness (`Decimal`)**:
///   Describes the asymmetry of the curve's distribution.
///   A positive value indicates a tail on the right, while a negative value

/// - **kurtosis (`Decimal`)**:
///   Indicates the tailedness of the curve's distribution. Higher values correspond
///   to more extreme values in the tails.
/// - **peaks (`Vec<Point2D>`)**:
///   Collection of `Point2D` instances indicating the global or local maxima (peaks) along the curve.
/// - **valleys (`Vec<Point2D>`)**:

/// - **inflection_points (`Vec<Point2D>`)**:
///   Points where the curve changes its concavity, transitioning from concave up
///   to concave down (or vice versa).
///
/// # Applications
/// This structure is a core component of the `CurveAnalysisResult` and plays an
/// essential role in:
/// - Financial metrics analysis (e.g., identifying extreme price levels or trend reversals)

/// - Locating key turning points like peaks, valleys, or moments of inflection
///
/// # Traits Implemented
/// - `Debug`: Provides a human-readable representation of the structure, useful for debugging.
/// - `Clone`: Enables the structure to be cloned, creating a deep copy of its contents.

/// - **r_squared**: A `Decimal` value known as the coefficient of determination.
///     - Measures the goodness-of-fit of the regression line to the data. A value
///       closer to 1 indicates a stronger fit.
/// - **moving_average**: A `Vec<Point2D>` representing the smoothed version of the data points using a moving

///   snapshots at different stages of data analysis.
///
/// # Example
/// The `TrendMetrics` is commonly used in conjunction with data manipulation and statistical
/// libraries for performing tasks such as regression analysis, smoothing, and statistical modeling.
///
/// - The `slope` and `intercept` values can be used directly to create the equation of a trend line:
///   `y = slope * x + intercept`.
/// - The `r_squared` value provides insights into the reliability of the linear model.
/// - The moving average offers a simplified view of the data points, useful for visualizations and
///   identifying key trends without noise.
///
/// This struct is most useful in applications that require detailed statistical computations and
/// visualization of linear trends and smoothed data.

/// Represents a collection of key financial risk metrics used in risk analysis
/// and performance evaluation.
///
/// # Overview
/// The `RiskMetrics` structure encapsulates a set of quantitative measures
/// that assess the risk and performance characteristics of a financial portfolio,
/// asset, or investment strategy. These metrics provide insights into the
/// variability, potential losses, and overall return of the analyzed entity.
///
/// ## Components
///
/// - **Volatility (`volatility`)**:
///   Measures the degree of variation in the returns of an asset or portfolio over time.
///   It is a widely used indicator of market risk, reflecting the extent to which returns
///   deviate from their average.
///   
/// - **Value at Risk (VaR) (`value_at_risk`)**:
///   Quantifies the maximum expected loss of an investment over a defined time horizon,
///   with a given confidence level. It is essential for understanding tail-risk and
///   evaluating potential losses in extreme conditions.
///
/// - **Expected Shortfall (ES) (`expected_shortfall`)**:
///   Represents the average loss in the worst-case scenarios (beyond the VaR threshold).
///   It provides a more comprehensive assessment of tail risk than VaR alone.
///
/// - **Beta (`beta`)**:
///   Measures the sensitivity of an asset's returns to the market returns.
///   A beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility compared to the market,
///   while a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.
///   Useful for determining the systemic risk in relation to the broader market.
///
/// - **Sharpe Ratio (`sharpe_ratio`)**:
///   Indicates the risk-adjusted return by comparing the portfolio's excess return
///   (return above the risk-free rate) to its volatility. It helps to evaluate
///   whether the returns justify the associated risk profile.
///
/// ## Applications
/// The `RiskMetrics` structure is commonly utilized in:
///
/// - **Portfolio Management**:
///   To assess and balance risk-return trade-offs in portfolio construction and optimization.
/// - **Risk Management**:
///   To estimate potential losses and evaluate exposure to adverse market conditions.
/// - **Performance Analysis**:
///   To compare the investment's performance against benchmarks and alternative strategies.
/// - **Financial Modeling**:
///   To perform stress testing, scenario analysis, and forecasting using historical data.
///
/// ## Field Descriptions
///
/// - **volatility**: [`Decimal`]
///   - Indicates the standard deviation of returns, quantifying the asset's return variability.
/// - **value_at_risk**: [`Decimal`]
///   - Specifies the maximum expected loss at a specified confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%).
/// - **expected_shortfall**: [`Decimal`]
///   - Represents the average loss in the worst scenarios beyond the VaR threshold.
/// - **beta**: [`Decimal`]
///   - Describes the systemic risk by measuring market sensitivity.
/// - **sharpe_ratio**: [`Decimal`]
///   - Indicates the risk-adjusted performance of the investment.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// The `RiskMetrics` structure is a critical component in financial analysis and
/// often serves as an input to higher-level structures like [`crate::geometrics::Metrics`]. By
/// combining these risk metrics with other statistical measures, it is possible to
/// gain a comprehensive understanding of the risk-return characteristics of an asset
/// or portfolio.
///
/// ## Related Concepts
/// - [`Metrics`]: Aggregates risk
///   alongside other statistical measures (e.g., trend, range, and shape metrics).
/// - **Financial Risk Indicators**:
///   Includes measures like maximum drawdown, Treynor ratio, and Sortino ratio
///   (typically used alongside `RiskMetrics` for advanced analysis).
///
/// ## Note
/// For accuracy and meaningful interpretation, ensure that the data used to compute
/// these metrics represents a sufficiently long-time horizon and is free from anomalies.
