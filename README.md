## Recent Updates

### Implementation of the Binomial Model for Option Pricing

We have successfully implemented a robust binomial model for option pricing. This implementation includes:

1. **Flexible Option Types**: Our model now supports various option types including European, American, and exotic options like Asian, Barrier, and more.

2. **Comprehensive Pricing Parameters**: We've introduced a `BinomialPricingParams` struct that encapsulates all necessary parameters for option pricing, including asset price, volatility, interest rate, strike price, time to expiry, number of steps, option type, option style (Call/Put), and trade side (Long/Short).

3. **Efficient Pricing Algorithm**: The `price_binomial` function implements an efficient binomial tree algorithm for option pricing. It handles special cases such as zero time to expiry and zero volatility.

4. **Support for Both Call and Put Options**: Our implementation allows pricing of both call and put options through the `OptionStyle` enum.

5. **Long and Short Positions**: The model accounts for both long and short positions in options through the `Side` enum.

6. **Payoff Trait**: We've introduced a `Payoff` trait that allows for easy extension to new option types in the future.

7. **Comprehensive Test Suite**: We've developed a suite of unit tests to ensure the accuracy of our pricing model under various scenarios, including edge cases.

8. **Code Optimization**: We've addressed Clippy warnings and optimized our code for better performance and readability.

9. **Detailed Documentation**: We've added comprehensive documentation to our main pricing function, explaining its usage, parameters, and providing examples.

### Future Work

- Implement additional exotic option types
- Enhance the model to handle dividends
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy option pricing
- Implement additional pricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo) for comparison
